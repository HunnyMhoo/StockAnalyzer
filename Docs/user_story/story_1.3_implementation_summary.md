# User Story 1.3 - Implementation Summary

**Feature Extraction from Labeled Data - COMPLETED ✅**

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive feature extraction system that converts labeled stock pattern windows into structured numerical features for machine learning. The system extracts **18 numerical features** across 4 categories, exceeding the minimum requirement of 10 features.

## 🎯 Requirements Met

### ✅ Functional Requirements

1. **Inputs** - All supported:
   - ✅ Labeled pattern list from `labeled_patterns.json`
   - ✅ OHLCV data from `./data/{ticker}.csv`
   - ✅ Configurable window size (default: 30 days)

2. **Output** - Fully implemented:
   - ✅ One row per labeled pattern
   - ✅ Pandas DataFrame format: `(num_samples, num_features)`
   - ✅ Saved to: `./features/labeled_features.csv`

3. **Core Feature Set** - All 18 features implemented:

   **A. Trend Context Features (3):**
   - ✅ `prior_trend_return`: % return from day -30 to day -1 before window
   - ✅ `above_sma_50_ratio`: % of days in prior 30-day period where close > 50-day SMA
   - ✅ `trend_angle`: linear regression slope of closing price in prior 30 days

   **B. Correction Phase Features (3):**
   - ✅ `drawdown_pct`: max % drop from recent high during current window
   - ✅ `recovery_return_pct`: return from drawdown low to final day
   - ✅ `down_day_ratio`: % of red candles in first half of window

   **C. False Support Break Features (5):**
   - ✅ `support_level`: minimum low from last 10 days before window
   - ✅ `support_break_depth_pct`: % below support the lowest low dropped
   - ✅ `false_break_flag`: 1 if price broke below support but closed above it within 3 bars
   - ✅ `recovery_days`: number of days from support break to recovery close
   - ✅ `recovery_volume_ratio`: volume on recovery candle / 20-day average volume

   **D. Technical Indicators (7):**
   - ✅ `sma_5`, `sma_10`, `sma_20`: Simple moving averages
   - ✅ `rsi_14`: 14-day Relative Strength Index
   - ✅ `macd_diff`: MACD histogram (difference between MACD and signal line)
   - ✅ `volatility`: standard deviation of returns
   - ✅ `volume_avg_ratio`: volume on last day / 20-day average

4. **Metadata Columns** - All included:
   - ✅ `ticker`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `label_type`, `notes`

### ✅ Non-Functional Requirements

- ✅ Each feature returns float or boolean, with no missing values
- ✅ Incomplete segments (fewer than required candles) are skipped with warnings
- ✅ Calculations are reproducible and encapsulated in functions
- ✅ Feature extractor allows new fields to be added easily
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ **18 engineered features** extracted for every valid labeled pattern (exceeds 10 minimum)
2. ✅ Final output CSV contains one row per pattern with consistent schema
3. ✅ Missing data results in skipped rows with warnings
4. ✅ `false_break_flag` correctly identifies breaks and recoveries
5. ✅ `support_level` accurately computed from 10 days before window
6. ✅ System handles various edge cases and data quality issues
