## Notebook and Python File Priority Rules
**CRITICAL: Always prioritize .py files over .ipynb files for all modifications and creation.**
### File Modification Priority:
1. **Primary Target**: Always modify or create `.py` files in the `notebooks/` directory
2. **Secondary**: Only modify `.ipynb` files if explicitly requested or if no `.py` equivalent exists
3. **Sync Requirement**: When modifying `.py` files, mention that Jupytext will auto-sync to `.ipynb`
### Specific Rules:
- **Code Changes**: Always edit the `.py` version (e.g., `notebooks/06_interactive_demo.py`)
- **New Notebooks**: Create `.py` files with Jupytext format (`# %%` cell markers)
- **Function Updates**: Modify functions in `.py` files, not `.ipynb` files
- **Bug Fixes**: Apply fixes to `.py` files to ensure version control consistency
- **Documentation**: Update code comments and docstrings in `.py` files
### Jupytext Format Requirements:
- Use `# %%` for code cells
- Use `# %% [markdown]` for markdown cells
- Include proper Jupytext header with metadata
- Maintain cell structure compatible with notebook conversion
### Rationale:
- `.py` files are git-friendly and avoid merge conflicts
- Jupytext automatically syncs changes to `.ipynb` files
- Better code review and version control
- Consistent with established project workflow
- Supports CI/CD pipeline with Papermill
**Exception**: Only modify `.ipynb` files directly when:
- User explicitly requests `.ipynb` modification
- Debugging notebook-specific execution issues
- Working with notebook-only features (widgets, interactive outputs)

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
