## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

## Notebook and Python File Priority Rules

**CRITICAL: Always prioritize .py files over .ipynb files for all modifications and creation.**

### File Modification Priority:
1. **Primary Target**: Always modify or create `.py` files in the `notebooks/` directory
2. **Secondary**: Only modify `.ipynb` files if explicitly requested or if no `.py` equivalent exists
3. **Sync Requirement**: When modifying `.py` files, mention that Jupytext will auto-sync to `.ipynb`

### Specific Rules:
- **Code Changes**: Always edit the `.py` version (e.g., `notebooks/06_interactive_demo.py`)
- **New Notebooks**: Create `.py` files with Jupytext format (`# %%` cell markers)
- **Function Updates**: Modify functions in `.py` files, not `.ipynb` files
- **Bug Fixes**: Apply fixes to `.py` files to ensure version control consistency
- **Documentation**: Update code comments and docstrings in `.py` files

### Jupytext Format Requirements:
- Use `# %%` for code cells
- Use `# %% [markdown]` for markdown cells
- Include proper Jupytext header with metadata
- Maintain cell structure compatible with notebook conversion

### Rationale:
- `.py` files are git-friendly and avoid merge conflicts
- Jupytext automatically syncs changes to `.ipynb` files
- Better code review and version control
- Consistent with established project workflow
- Supports CI/CD pipeline with Papermill

**Exception**: Only modify `.ipynb` files directly when:
- User explicitly requests `.ipynb` modification
- Debugging notebook-specific execution issues
- Working with notebook-only features (widgets, interactive outputs)

Hong Kong Stock Pattern Recognition System

Core Components:

1. Pattern Detection Engine (90)
- Specialized detection of "bull trend → dip → false resistance break" patterns
- 18+ technical indicators across 4 categories (trend, correction, support break, technical)
- Confidence-based pattern matching with thresholds (0.6-0.8)
- Hong Kong market-specific validation rules
Key files: src/pattern_scanner.py, src/feature_extractor.py

2. Stock Data Management (85)
- Four-tier collection framework:
  * Beginner: 10-50 stocks with safe rate limits
  * Intermediate: 50-200 stocks with sector focus
  * Advanced: 200-500 stocks for market coverage
  * Enterprise: 500+ parallel processing
- HK-specific ticker validation (XXXX.HK format)
Key files: src/bulk_data_fetcher.py, src/data_fetcher.py

3. Pattern Training Pipeline (80)
- Manual pattern tagging system with date range validation
- Feature extraction across trend context, correction phase, support breaks
- Model training with SMOTE balancing for pattern distributions
- Cross-validation specific to time series patterns
Key files: src/pattern_model_trainer.py

4. Signal Outcome Analysis (75)
- Three-tier confidence classification (High ≥0.8, Medium 0.6-0.8, Low <0.6)
- Success/failure tracking with feedback loop
- Pattern performance metrics by confidence bands
- Trading signal quality validation
Key files: src/signal_outcome_tagger.py

5. Technical Indicator Framework (70)
- Support/resistance break validation
- Volume confirmation requirements
- False breakout detection with recovery validation 
- Pattern-specific technical measurements
Key files: src/technical_indicators.py

Data flows through collection → feature extraction → pattern detection → signal validation, with market-specific rules and validations at each stage focused on Hong Kong exchange requirements and trading patterns.
