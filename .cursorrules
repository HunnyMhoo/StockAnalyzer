## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The Hong Kong Stock Pattern Recognition Engine implements specialized market analysis functionality across four core domains:

1. Pattern Recognition Core (90/100)
- Custom feature extraction system with 18 technical indicators 
- Support/resistance break pattern detection
- Four analysis categories:
  - Trend Context Features
  - Correction Phase Analysis
  - Support Break Detection
  - Technical Indicator Suite

2. Hong Kong Market Integration (85/100)
`src/bulk_data_fetcher.py`, `src/hk_stock_universe.py`
- HK-specific stock validation (XXXX.HK format)
- Sector categorization (tech, finance, property)
- Market-specific trading calendars
- Exchange-compliant rate limiting

3. Pattern Classification System (80/100)
`src/pattern_model_trainer.py`, `src/pattern_labeler.py`
- Binary pattern classification (positive/negative)
- Support break validation rules
- Volume confirmation requirements
- Pattern overlap prevention

4. Technical Analysis Engine (75/100)
`src/technical_indicators.py`, `src/feature_extractor.py`
- Custom drawdown calculations
- Recovery metrics
- False break detection
- Volume/price ratio analysis

The system implements a complete pipeline for Hong Kong stock pattern recognition:
1. Data collection with market-specific validation
2. Pattern labeling with strict classification rules
3. Feature extraction using 18 specialized indicators
4. Model training with pattern-specific evaluation metrics

Core business value centers on specialized Hong Kong market pattern recognition combining traditional technical analysis with machine learning validation while adhering to exchange-specific requirements.
