# data-flow-pipeline

The data pipeline consists of 5 major stages connecting data collection through pattern detection:

1. Data Collection Stage
Input: Hong Kong stock tickers (.HK format)
Processing:
- Bulk data fetcher (src/bulk_data_fetcher.py):
  - Sector-based collection (tech, finance, property)
  - Tiered batch sizing (5-50 stocks)
  - Intelligent caching with 7-day freshness
Output: Raw OHLCV data for HK stocks

2. Feature Extraction Stage
Input: Raw OHLCV data
Processing:
- Feature extractor (src/feature_extractor.py):
  - 18+ technical indicators across 4 categories
  - Window-based calculation (20-30 days)
  - Pattern-specific feature generation
Output: Normalized feature vectors

3. Pattern Labeling Stage 
Input: Feature vectors + expert knowledge
Processing:
- Pattern labeler (src/pattern_labeler.py):
  - Manual pattern identification
  - Positive/negative classification
  - Date range validation
Output: Labeled pattern instances

4. Model Training Stage
Input: Labeled patterns
Processing:
- Model trainer (src/pattern_model_trainer.py):
  - SMOTE balancing for pattern classes
  - XGBoost/RandomForest optimization
  - Cross-validation for pattern reliability
Output: Trained pattern detection models

5. Pattern Scanning Stage
Input: New market data + trained models
Processing:
- Pattern scanner (src/pattern_scanner.py):
  - Sliding window pattern detection
  - Confidence scoring (0.5-0.8 threshold)
  - Multi-model consensus
Output: Pattern matches with confidence scores

Key Data Flow Integration Points:

1. Collection → Feature Extraction
- Cached data handoff
- Missing data validation
- HK market format verification

2. Feature Extraction → Pattern Labeling
- Feature vector standardization
- Window alignment
- Technical indicator calculation

3. Pattern Labeling → Model Training
- Label balancing
- Feature selection
- Cross-validation splits

4. Model Training → Pattern Scanning
- Model persistence
- Feature scaling preservation
- Confidence calibration

The pipeline emphasizes data integrity and validation specific to Hong Kong market characteristics throughout each stage while maintaining pattern detection accuracy.

Importance Scores:
- Data Collection: 85 (Critical market data acquisition)
- Feature Extraction: 90 (Core pattern recognition)
- Pattern Labeling: 95 (Expert knowledge capture)
- Model Training: 80 (Pattern learning)
- Pattern Scanning: 85 (Production pattern detection)
