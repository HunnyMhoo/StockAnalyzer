# data-flow-pipeline

The data pipeline consists of several key stages for processing Hong Kong stock data:

## 1. Data Collection Stage
- **Bulk Collection Pipeline**
  - Fetches Hong Kong stock data in configurable batches with rate limiting
  - Implements sector-based collection (Tech, Finance, Property)
  - Provides intelligent caching with incremental updates
  - Files: `notebooks/02_bulk_data_collection.py`, `src/bulk_data_fetcher.py`

## 2. Feature Extraction Stage
- **Pattern Feature Pipeline**
  - Extracts 18+ numerical features across 4 categories:
    - Trend Context: prior_trend_return, above_sma_50_ratio, trend_angle
    - Correction Phase: drawdown_pct, recovery_return_pct, down_day_ratio
    - False Support Break: support_level, break_depth_pct, recovery metrics
    - Technical Indicators: SMAs, RSI, MACD, volatility
  - Files: `notebooks/04_feature_extraction.py`, `src/feature_extractor.py`

## 3. Pattern Labeling Stage
- **Manual Pattern Tagging**
  - Labels patterns as positive/negative/neutral examples
  - Validates pattern structure and date ranges
  - Stores labeled patterns with metadata
  - Files: `stock_analyzer/patterns/labeler.py`

## 4. Model Training Stage
- **Pattern Recognition Pipeline**
  - Trains models on labeled patterns using extracted features
  - Implements training workflows for XGBoost and RandomForest
  - Cross-validates models with domain-specific metrics
  - Files: `notebooks/05_pattern_model_training.py`, `src/pattern_model_trainer.py`

## 5. Pattern Scanning Stage
- **Market Scanning Pipeline**
  - Scans Hong Kong stocks using trained models
  - Implements sliding window pattern detection
  - Ranks matches by confidence score
  - Files: `notebooks/06_pattern_scanning.py`, `src/pattern_scanner.py`

## 6. Result Evaluation Stage 
- **Outcome Analysis Pipeline**
  - Tags pattern match outcomes (success/failure)
  - Analyzes performance by confidence bands
  - Generates feedback for model improvement
  - Files: `src/signal_outcome_tagger.py`, `stock_analyzer/analysis/outcome.py`

## 7. Model Evaluation Stage
- **Performance Analysis Pipeline**
  - Calculates pattern detection metrics
  - Analyzes misclassifications
  - Studies prediction confidence distribution
  - Files: `src/model_evaluator.py`, `stock_analyzer/analysis/evaluator.py`

The pipeline integrates specialized components for Hong Kong stock analysis, maintaining data quality and model performance through systematic feedback loops.
