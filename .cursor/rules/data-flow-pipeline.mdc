# data-flow-pipeline

## Data Collection Flow
Importance: 85
- Hong Kong stock data collection with tiered complexity:
  1. Entry (10-50 stocks)
  2. Intermediate (50-200 stocks) 
  3. Advanced (200-500 stocks)
  4. Enterprise (500+ stocks)
- Sector-based batch processing with optimized rate limiting
- Data quality validation with 80% completeness requirement

## Feature Engineering Pipeline 
Importance: 90
- Technical indicator calculation flow:
  1. Price trend features
  2. Support/resistance metrics  
  3. Volatility indicators
  4. Volume analysis
- Pattern-specific feature extraction
- Quality checks and validation gates

## Pattern Training Flow
Importance: 95
- Model training pipeline:
  1. Pattern labeling with positive/negative examples
  2. Feature standardization 
  3. Model selection (XGBoost/Random Forest)
  4. Cross-validation
- Confidence scoring system
- Model persistence and versioning

## Pattern Detection Flow
Importance: 90
- Real-time scanning pipeline:
  1. Window-based pattern scanning
  2. Confidence threshold filtering
  3. Pattern ranking and prioritization
  4. Match validation
- Sector-specific optimizations
- Performance tracking and metrics

## Signal Analysis Flow
Importance: 85
- Pattern outcome tracking:
  1. Success/failure classification
  2. Confidence band analysis
  3. Performance metrics calculation
  4. Feedback loop for model refinement
