# data-flow-pipeline

Core Data Pipeline Components:

1. Data Collection (src/bulk_data_fetcher.py, src/data_fetcher.py):
- HK stock data validation and processing
- Market-specific caching with integrity checks
- Sector-based batch processing aligned with HK exchange requirements
- Stock universe segmentation by market sectors
Importance: 85

2. Pattern Labeling (src/pattern_labeler.py):
- Structure for labeling trading patterns with start/end dates
- Pattern type classification (positive/negative/neutral)
- Label validation enforcing HK market requirements
- Pattern overlap detection and metadata tracking
Importance: 90

3. Feature Extraction (src/feature_extractor.py):
- 18 technical features across 4 categories:
  * Trend Context (returns, SMA ratios, angles)
  * Correction Phase (drawdowns, recovery metrics)
  * Support Break Analysis (levels, break depth)
  * Technical Indicators (RSI, MACD, volume)
- Window-based extraction with prior context analysis
Importance: 95

4. Model Training (src/pattern_model_trainer.py):
- Pattern detection pipeline with binary classification
- SMOTE handling for imbalanced pattern distributions
- Pattern-specific feature validation
- Cross-validation with stratification for consistency
Importance: 85

5. Model Evaluation (src/model_evaluator.py):
- Confidence scoring analysis
- Misclassification categorization
- Pattern-specific performance metrics
- Feature importance ranking system
Importance: 80

Data Flow Sequence:
1. Raw stock data collection → Market-specific validation
2. Pattern labeling → Metadata enrichment
3. Feature extraction → Technical indicator calculation
4. Model training → Pattern classification
5. Evaluation → Performance analysis

Key Integration Points:
- Data validation between collection and feature extraction
- Pattern label integration with feature calculation
- Feature standardization for model input
- Training output to evaluation pipeline
