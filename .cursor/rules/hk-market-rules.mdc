### Stock Pattern Recognition Framework
1. **Pattern Labeling Standards**
- Enforces Hong Kong stock ticker format validation (XXXX.HK)  
- Requires minimum pattern length of 5 days
- Classifies patterns as positive/negative/neutral
- Support break thresholds calibrated to HK market volatility (2% default)

2. **Data Quality Requirements**
- Minimum data freshness of 7 days
- Coverage criteria:
  - Large universe: ≥100 stocks
  - Good coverage: ≥50 stocks
  - Moderate: ≥20 stocks
  - Limited: <20 stocks
- Quality scoring tiers:
  - High: ≥0.8 score
  - Medium: ≥0.6 score
  - Low: <0.6 score

3. **Market Sector Organization**
- Blue chips (major established companies)
- Tech stocks (technology/internet)
- Finance (banks/insurance) 
- Property (real estate developers)
