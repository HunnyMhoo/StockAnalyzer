# pattern-recognition-algorithms

Core Feature Categories:

1. Trend Context Analysis (90/100)
- Prior trend return calculation over configurable windows 
- SMA-50 ratio analysis for trend positioning
- Trend angle measurement using regression
- Returns 6 trend-specific indicators

2. Support Break Detection (95/100)
- Identifies support levels from historical price data
- Measures break depth percentages
- False break validation with recovery confirmation
- Volume behavior tracking during recoveries
- Produces 3 support-related metrics

3. Correction Phase Analysis (85/100)
- Drawdown percentage calculation 
- Recovery metrics computation
- Down day ratio tracking
- Generates 5 correction indicators

4. Technical Signal Integration (75/100)
- Multiple SMA combinations (5/10/20)
- RSI-14 implementation
- MACD divergence computation
- Volume ratio analysis
- Outputs 4 technical metrics

Key Pattern Recognition Rules:
- Minimum 5-day window requirement
- Support level confirmation logic
- Volume confirmation for breakouts
- Pattern window sizing (20-day default)
- Confidence thresholds (0.6-0.8)

Validation Requirements:
- OHLCV data completeness checks
- Lookback period validation
- Support level confirmation rules
- Pattern overlap detection
- Minimum sample size (30) for training

Pattern Classification:
- Three-tier confidence bands:
  - High: â‰¥0.8
  - Medium: 0.6-0.8
  - Low: <0.6
- Binary classification (positive/negative)
- Pattern-specific feature extraction
- Multi-timeframe confirmation
