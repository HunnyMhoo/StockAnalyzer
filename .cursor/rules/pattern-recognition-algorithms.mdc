Core Pattern Recognition Components:

1. Price Pattern Detection (Importance: 95)
- False breakout identification using support/resistance levels
- Pattern confidence scoring (0.5-0.95 range)
- Recovery period validation after breakout (3-day default)
- Technical indicator correlation analysis
- Custom window sizing per pattern type (15-30 days)

2. Pattern Feature Extraction (Importance: 90) 
- Trend context metrics (prior_trend_return, above_sma_50_ratio)
- Correction phase analysis (drawdown_pct, recovery_return_pct)
- Support break detection (break_depth_pct, false_break_flag)
- Volume-price relationship indicators
- 18+ specialized technical indicators

3. Pattern Training Pipeline (Importance: 85)
- Two-phase model selection:
  * XGBoost for normal datasets
  * Random Forest fallback for small samples
- Minimum 11-15 samples required
- Negative sampling strategies:
  * Temporal recent (3 month window)
  * Multiple windows
  * Random diverse
- 2:1 negative-to-positive ratio requirement

4. Pattern Scanning System (Importance: 80)
- Sliding window implementation 
- Confidence thresholds (0.6-0.8)
- Quick scan mode (15-day windows)
- High-confidence mode (20+ days)
- Sector-specific confidence adjustments

5. Pattern Labeling Framework (Importance: 75)
- Positive/negative pattern classification
- Trading outcome tracking
- Pattern confidence bands:
  * High: ≥90%
  * Medium: 80-90%
  * Moderate: 70-80%
- Success rate analysis by confidence level
