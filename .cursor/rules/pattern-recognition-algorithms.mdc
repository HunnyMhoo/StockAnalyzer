## Core Pattern Recognition Components

### False Breakout Detection
- Identifies bull trend → dip → false resistance break patterns
- Requires 2% minimum upward trend and 2% break threshold
- Validates using 3-day recovery period
- Uses 30-day lookback window for pattern context

### Support/Resistance Analysis
- Dynamic support/resistance level identification using local minima/maxima
- False breakout validation using percentage-based thresholds
- Recent support level tracking with configurable lookback periods
- Break depth calculation with recovery volume analysis

### Technical Pattern Features
- RSI momentum analysis with custom windows
- MACD trend detection with configurable fast/slow periods
- Bollinger Bands volatility analysis with dynamic multipliers
- Custom trend strength using linear regression slopes
- Volume-to-average ratio for trading activity validation

### Pattern Scanning Workflow
- Sliding window pattern detection across multiple stocks
- Feature extraction aligned with model training
- Confidence score filtering with configurable thresholds
- Multi-stock parallel scanning with rate limiting
- Results ranking by confidence scores

### Signal Outcome Tagging
- Pattern match outcome tracking (success/failure/uncertain)
- Confidence band performance analysis 
- Tagged feedback integration into model training
- Historical match analysis for accuracy validation

### Pattern Visualization
- Detection window highlighting with support levels
- Volume subplot integration for pattern validation
- Confidence score filtering and match prioritization
- Custom technical overlay visualization

## Domain-Specific Validation

### Stock Pattern Validation
- Minimum 5-day pattern length requirement
- Hong Kong stock ticker format validation (XXXX.HK)
- Support break depth percentage thresholds
- Recovery period validation rules

### Quality Assessment
- Three-tier quality classification (high/medium/low)
- 50% high quality requirement for scanning
- 7-day data freshness threshold
- Stock universe size tier requirements

### Pattern Training Data
- Positive/negative example pattern pairs
- Label type validation (positive/negative/neutral)
- Pattern date range integrity checks
- Stock universe sector categorization
