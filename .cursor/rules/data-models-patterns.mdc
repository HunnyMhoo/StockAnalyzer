## Core Pattern Data Model

The system implements 18 technical features across 4 key categories for stock pattern analysis:

### 1. Trend Context Features (Importance: 95)
- prior_trend_return: Measures pre-pattern price movement
- above_sma_50_ratio: Price position relative to moving average
- trend_angle: Linear regression slope of price movement
- trend_r2: Trend line fit quality metric

### 2. Correction Phase Metrics (Importance: 90) 
- drawdown_pct: Maximum price decline percentage
- recovery_return_pct: Bounce magnitude from low
- down_day_ratio: Proportion of declining days
- volume_intensity: Volume spike detection

### 3. Support Break Analysis (Importance: 85)
- support_level: Key price support identification
- break_depth_pct: Support violation magnitude
- false_break_flag: Failed breakdown detection
- recovery_speed: Post-break price behavior

### 4. Technical Indicators (Importance: 80)
- rsi_14: Relative Strength Index
- macd_hist: MACD histogram values
- bb_position: Price location in Bollinger Bands
- volume_sma_ratio: Volume intensity metric
- price_volatility: Historical volatility measure
- trend_quality: Trend consistency score

## Pattern Classification System

Label Categories (Importance: 90):
1. Positive Patterns
- Successful false breakdowns
- Strong trend resumptions
- High confidence reversals

2. Negative Patterns  
- Failed recoveries
- Weak trend continuations
- Low confidence signals

3. Neutral/Uncertain
- Incomplete patterns
- Mixed signals
- Insufficient confirmation

## Feature Relationships

Key Correlations (Importance: 85):
- Support break depth vs recovery speed
- Volume intensity vs trend resumption
- Prior trend return vs recovery magnitude
- Technical indicator convergence/divergence

Implementation Paths:
```
stock_analyzer/features/
├── extractor.py     # Feature calculation engine
├── indicators.py    # Technical indicator implementations
└── validator.py     # Feature quality validation

```

The pattern recognition system emphasizes the relationship between technical features and pattern outcomes, with specialized implementations for Hong Kong market characteristics. Feature extraction and pattern classification are tightly integrated through the validation and analysis pipeline.
