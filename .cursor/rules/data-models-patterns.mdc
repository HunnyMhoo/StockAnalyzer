## Core Pattern Data Structures

1. Pattern Label Classification (Importance: 95)
- Three-state classification system: positive, negative, neutral 
- Required fields: ticker (XXXX.HK format), date range, label type, notes
- Pattern validation rules prevent overlapping labels
- Atomic updates with audit timestamps

2. Technical Features (Importance: 90)
- 18 distinct features across 4 categories:

a) Trend Context
- Prior trend return
- Above SMA-50 ratio
- Trend angle
- SMA crossover patterns

b) Correction Phase  
- Drawdown percentage
- Recovery return
- Down day ratio
- Recovery period metrics

c) Support Break Analysis
- Support level detection
- Break depth percentage
- False break flags
- Recovery volume ratios

d) Technical Indicators
- RSI-14 values
- MACD differentials
- Volatility measures
- Volume ratios

3. Pattern Recognition Rules (Importance: 85)
- Minimum 10 features required for pattern confirmation
- Volume confirmation requirements
- Configurable lookback windows
- Binary classification with confidence scoring

4. Feature Output Format (Importance: 80)
- 23 standardized columns:
  - 5 metadata fields
  - 18 technical features
- Quality controls for missing data
- Feature categorization for ML input

## Pattern Model Training Structure (Importance: 75)

1. Training Data Requirements
- Minimum 30 samples per pattern class
- SMOTE balancing for pattern distributions
- Cross-validation with pattern stratification

2. Model Features
- Feature scaling based on pattern complexity
- Pattern-specific evaluation metrics
- Feature importance ranking system
- Model confidence analysis in 0.1 increments

## Support Break Pattern Model (Importance: 70)

1. Break Detection Features
- Support level identification using local minima
- Break depth calculations
- False break validation rules
- Volume confirmation metrics

2. Pattern Validation
- Break threshold percentages
- Recovery period validation
- Volume-based confirmation rules
- Trend context requirements
