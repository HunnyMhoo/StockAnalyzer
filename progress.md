### 2024-12-19: Notebook Structure Cleanup & Duplicate Method Resolution

**🔧 Issue Addressed:**
- Fixed critical structural issues in `02_bulk_data_collection.ipynb`
- Resolved duplicate Method 5 implementations causing confusion
- Cleaned up outdated and inconsistent cell content

**✅ Changes Made:**

#### 1. **Duplicate Method Removal**
- **Before**: Multiple Method 5 cells scattered throughout notebook (cells 13, 14, 15, 37, 45)
- **After**: Single, clean Method 5 implementation with proper structure
- Removed 4 duplicate/broken Method 5 implementations
- Fixed method numbering inconsistencies

#### 2. **Cell Structure Optimization**
- Removed empty and unnecessary cells (cells 16, 25, 26, 43, 45)
- Cleaned up broken cell content with mixed implementations
- Fixed markdown vs code cell type inconsistencies
- Eliminated debug artifacts (e.g., `len(all_major_stocks)` leftover cell)

#### 3. **Method Numbering Correction**
- Fixed mislabeled completion messages:
  - Method 6: Data management (was incorrectly labeled as Method 5)
  - Method 7: Error handling (was incorrectly labeled as Method 6) 
  - Method 8: Parallel processing (was incorrectly labeled as Method 7)
- Updated summary section to reflect correct method sequence

#### 4. **Content Consolidation**
- **Method 5**: Now single, comprehensive implementation with:
  - Safety controls (`EXECUTE_FULL_FETCH = False` by default)
  - Demo mode with configurable size (50 stocks)
  - Full universe capability when enabled
  - Proper progress tracking and error handling
- Removed outdated 7000+ stock generation approach
- Streamlined to use discovered stock universe approach

**📊 Final Structure:**
```
Setup (Cells 0-4): Headers, imports, configuration
Method 1: Stock categories exploration  
Method 2: Smart batching demonstration
Method 3: Sector-specific fetching
Method 4: Stock universe discovery
Method 5: Comprehensive HK market fetch (SINGLE clean implementation)
Method 6: Data management & saving
Method 7: Error handling & retry logic  
Method 8: Parallel processing (advanced)
Summary: Best practices and recommendations
```

**🎯 Impact:**
- **Eliminated confusion** from multiple Method 5 implementations
- **Improved usability** with clear, sequential method progression
- **Enhanced safety** with proper default controls
- **Reduced cell count** from 52 to clean, functional structure
- **Fixed linter issues** and code inconsistencies

**🔍 Technical Details:**
- Total cells cleaned: 7 cells removed/consolidated
- Duplicate headers removed: 4 instances
- Method numbering corrections: 3 methods
- Safety controls added: Default `EXECUTE_FULL_FETCH = False`
- Demo size configured: 50 stocks for testing
