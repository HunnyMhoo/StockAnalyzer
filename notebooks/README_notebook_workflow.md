# Notebook Workflow Improvements

## Overview
Phase 1 improvements implemented to enhance notebook development and collaboration for the Hong Kong Stock Pattern Recognition project.

## What's New

### 1. Automatic Output Stripping (nbstripout)
**What it does:** Automatically removes all output cells, execution counts, and large embedded images from notebooks when you commit to git.

**Benefits:**
- **Smaller diffs:** No more 3MB JSON blobs in pull requests
- **No merge conflicts:** Output cells won't cause merge conflicts anymore  
- **Reduced repo size:** Binaries/plots only exist in working copy
- **Cleaner history:** Focus on code changes, not output variations

**How it works:**
- Installed automatically via git hooks
- Runs every time you `git commit`
- Notebook code, markdown, and metadata stay intact
- Only outputs are removed from committed version

### 2. Python Script Exports
**What it does:** Key notebooks now have corresponding `.py` files for better code review.

**Available scripts:**
- `01_data_collection.py` - Core data fetching logic
- `04_feature_extraction.py` - Feature engineering algorithms  
- `05_pattern_model_training.py` - ML model training pipeline
- `06_pattern_scanning.py` - Pattern detection logic

**Benefits:**
- **Better code reviews:** Plain text diffs instead of JSON
- **Search & grep:** Find functions and variables easily
- **Git blame:** Track changes to specific algorithms
- **Documentation:** Clear view of the core logic

## Developer Workflow

### Daily Use
1. **Develop normally** in Jupyter notebooks
2. **Commit as usual** - nbstripout handles output stripping automatically
3. **Review code** using the `.py` files for algorithm changes
4. **Update `.py` exports** when making significant changes to core notebooks

### Updating Python Exports
When you make significant changes to the core notebooks, refresh the `.py` exports:

```bash
# Export specific notebook
jupyter nbconvert --to script notebooks/04_feature_extraction.ipynb --output-dir notebooks/

# Or export all key notebooks
jupyter nbconvert --to script notebooks/{01_data_collection,04_feature_extraction,05_pattern_model_training,06_pattern_scanning}.ipynb --output-dir notebooks/
```

## File Size Impact
The improvement in repository efficiency:

| Notebook | Original Size | Python Script | Reduction |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| `01_data_collection.ipynb` | 216KB | 4.8KB | 98% |
| `04_feature_extraction.ipynb` | 40KB | 8.3KB | 79% |  
| `05_pattern_model_training.ipynb` | 153KB | 10.4KB | 93% |
| `06_pattern_scanning.ipynb` | 39KB | 11KB | 72% |

## Technical Details

### nbstripout Configuration
- **Git filter:** Configured in `.gitattributes`
- **Automatic:** Runs on `git add` and `git commit`
- **Reversible:** Original outputs preserved in working directory

### Dependencies
- `nbstripout>=0.6.1` added to `requirements.txt`
- No additional manual setup required for new team members

## Next Steps (Future Phases)
- **Phase 2:** Automated Jupytext sync for bidirectional editing
- **Phase 3:** CI/CD pipeline with Papermill for notebook testing
